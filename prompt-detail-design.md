Analyze the current source code and create a comprehensive design document for the "/api/recipe" route endpoint.

## Document Requirements:

### 1. Business-Centric Focus
- Focus primarily on business logic, workflows, and functional requirements
- Minimize code implementation details and syntax-specific examples
- Ensure the document is technology-agnostic and can be adapted to different programming languages or frameworks

### 2. Content Structure
Please include the following sections:

#### A. Executive Summary
- Brief overview of the recipe API endpoint purpose and scope

#### B. Business Requirements
- Functional requirements for recipe management
- User stories and use cases
- Business rules and constraints

#### C. API Specification
- Endpoint details (HTTP methods, URL structure)
- Request/response data models (using generic schema notation)
- Input validation rules
- Error handling scenarios

#### D. Business Process Flow
- Step-by-step workflow description
- Decision points and business logic branching
- Data transformation requirements

#### E. Integration Points
- Dependencies on other systems/services
- External API calls or database interactions
- Authentication and authorization requirements

#### F. Sequence Diagrams
- Create detailed sequence diagrams to illustrate:
  - Request-response flow
  - Inter-service communication
  - Error handling scenarios
- Use standard UML notation

#### G. Data Management
- Data persistence requirements
- CRUD operation specifications
- Data validation and business rules

#### H. Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance expectations
- Security considerations
- Scalability requirements

### 3. Output Specifications
- Generate the document in Markdown format
- Save the file as `recipe-api-design.md` in the `./docs` folder
- Use clear headings, bullet points, and structured formatting
- Include diagrams using Mermaid syntax where applicable

### 4. Quality Standards
- Ensure the document is implementation-independent
- Focus on "what" and "why" rather than "how"
- Make it suitable for cross-functional teams (developers, product managers, QA)
- Include sufficient detail for implementation in any technology stack
